<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>Access to the properties and methods created by the parent object(s).</p>

<p>Using our Book from earlier:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript" contenteditable>// The constructor function
function Paperback(title, author, numPages, cover) {
  Book.call(this, title, author, numPages);
  this.cover = cover;
}
// Extending the Book object
Paperback.prototype = Object.create(Book.prototype);</code></pre>

<p>Because it inherits from <code>Book</code>, <code>Paperback</code> has the properties and methods available to book as well.</p>
