## Course description

Nowadays, we are using JavaScript more and more on our webpages, and that means that we can end up with hundreds or even thousands of lines of JS. If you're not careful, your code can quickly become an unnavigable maze of spaghetti code. Most web developers are now using Object-oriented concepts to help them modularize their code and make it more re-usable.

In this afternoon workshop, we'll give an overview of Object-oriented JavaScript, and spend most of our time actually getting our hands dirty using those concepts.

This is intended to be a follow-up workshop for JS101, or for those already comfortable with JavaScript looking to expand their skills.
