          <p>Break into groups of 2 (or 3, whichever works out best) and designate one person to take notes (ideally this person has a pen and paper so you can all see what they are writing). In this exercise, we are going to create a <code>Fish</code> object and play with inheritance. Don't worry, we're not coding yet. This is just for practice! (If you're not as into fish as me, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish">this article may help</a>.)</p>

          <p>Check out this sweet list of fish:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_shark">Tiger shark</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuna">Tuna</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiprioninae">Clownfish</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfish">Goldfish</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon">Salmon</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagfish">Hagfish</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark">Whale shark</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Your mission:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Come up with a list of <strong>behaviors</strong> shared by <em>all</em> of the fish in this list</li>
            <li>Come up with a list of <strong>attributes</strong> shared by <em>all</em> of the fish in this list</li>
            <li>Are there any behaviors or attributes that apply to only one of these fish? List them!</li>
            <li>Are there any behaviors or attributes that apply to two or more of these fish? List them and try to come up with names that describe the group they apply to.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Sometimes drawing diagrams helps, but feel free to use whatever system helps you to stay organized.</p>

          <h3>You have 15 minutes. GO GO GO!</h3>

          <h4>Make sure to take notes! We'll be sharing our work when we're done.</h4>

          <p>Fun fact: The plural of one type of "fish" is "fish."" If you're describing multiple kinds of fish, you use "fishes."</p>
