<h2>Refactoring</h2>

<p>Refactoring is a process developers use to re-write their code. There are lots of different reasons why you would want to refactor your code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You want to make it easier to read</li>
  <li>You want to make it more modular so you can use the different pieces in multiple projects and places</li>
  <li>You want to make it run faster or have better performance</li>
  <li>You know a lot more now than you did then, and you can make it better!</li>
</ul>
